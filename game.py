"""
Phase 1: The Core Logic (Pure Python, Text-Only)
    Goal:           Create a version of Echo Hunt that two people can play sitting at the same computer, taking turns typing in their commands in the terminal.
    Skills Needed:  Basic Python (variables, loops, functions, maybe a simple class).
    My Role(AI):    I will guide you in creating the Python code for the game board, placing ships, checking for hits/echoes, and handling player turns.
